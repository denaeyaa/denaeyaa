I'm very interested in the world of machine learning and am exploring it passionately. Currently, I'm exploring Python as my main programming language. Every day is a new opportunity to absorb knowledge and expand my horizons in this dynamic world. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field, as well as sharing my knowledge with the community. Come on, let's explore this world together!
